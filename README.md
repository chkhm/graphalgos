Experimenting with graph algorithms. Basically a playground for some learning experience. It starts with a small library to read graphs from a json file. Then will come a little application to turn them into graphviz for visualization. After that infrastructure part comes some algorithms such as finding the shortest path, n-shortest path, etc. Let's see how far we get.
